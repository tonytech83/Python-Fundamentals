<h5 align="center">
With the Programming Fundamentals course, students begin to study SoftUni's in-house program for the comprehensive training of software engineers. The course examines fundamental concepts in programming, which are the basis for effective and quality training in the professional modules. Learners build on the knowledge gained in the Programming Basics course and begin to use more complex programming concepts and structures such as: arrays, sheets, objects and classes.

Additional technologies needed by every software developer are studied, such as HTML and CSS, HTTP, bitwise operations, and more. The basics of web development are covered, as well as some of the most common technologies and tools, with which the course successfully builds an idea in the students about the upcoming professional modules and the knowledge they will gain from them to become successful software developers.
